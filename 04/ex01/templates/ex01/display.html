{% block content %}
<p>A static web page (sometimes called a flat page or a 
    stationary page) is a web page that is delivered to the 
    user's web browser exactly as stored,[1] in contrast to 
    dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application.
    Consequently, a static web page often displays the same
     information for all users, from all contexts, subject 
     to modern capabilities of a web server to negotiate 
     content-type or language of the document where such 
     versions are available and the server is configured to do 
     so.[3] However, a site's scripts can introduce dynamic 
     unctionality, which may make a static web page appear dynamic.

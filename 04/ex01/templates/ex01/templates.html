<p>
        Being a web framework, Django needs a convenient way to generate HTML dynamically.
    the most common approach relies on templates. A template contains the static parts 
    of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic 
    content will be inserted. For a hands-on example of creating HTML pages with templates.
    A Django project can be configured with one or several template engines 
    (or even zero if you donâ€™t use templates). Django ships built-in backends
    for its own template system, creatively called the Django template language
    (DTL), and for the popular alternative Jinja2. Backends for other template 
    languages may be available from third-parties. You can also write your own custom backend.
    Django defines a standard API for loading and rendering templates regardless of the backend.
    Loading consists of finding the template for a given identifier and preprocessing it,
    usually compiling it to an in-memory representation. Rendering means interpolating the template with context 
    data and returning the resulting string.

<p> 
        Blocks: In master templates the block tag is a placeholder that will be
    replaced by a block in a child template with the same name. In child 
    templates the block tag is content that will replace the placeholder 
    in the master template with the same name.
</p>
<p> 
        Loops for in : For loop is used to iterate over any iterable object, 
    accessing one item at a time and making it available inside the for loop body. 
    For example, if you want to create a drop down of countries in Django template, 
    you can use the below code.
</p>
<p> 
        if control structures:f the expression evaluates to True then the statements
    1 to n will be executed followed by statement always executed . If the expression 
    is False, only statement always executed is executed. Python knows which lines
    of code are related to the if statement by the indentation, no extra syntax is 
    necessary.
</p>
<p> 
        The display of passing context variables :The context_processors option is a list of 
    callables - called context processors that take a request object as their argument
    and return a dictionary of items to be merged into the context. In the default 
    generated settings file.
